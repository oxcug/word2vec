# Word2vec

A very basic matrix math, neural net, one hot encoder and word2vec implementation in pure swift and is not accelerated in any way.

Quick hobby project to learn more about AI concepts, written very loose and diry. Far from a production-ready implementation.

I'm sure there are plenty of bugs and incorrectly implemented details here but does represent the overall structure of the algorithm. Feel free to reach out/fork with questions or corrections.
